## About
The  work undertaken in weeks 2 and 5 of the module, Infrastructure as Code is presented here. The work comes in the form of 12 walkthroughs with each walkthrough designed to develop and build an understanding of the basic principles of the Python programming language whilst also progressing towards the development of the required skills to script efficiently and effectively in Python . In walkthrough 1 to 3, after being introduced to Python in the command prompt environment, sample code is then entered and saved in Notepad++ and run via the interpreter using the command line. Walkthroughs 4 to 6 introduce Virtual Studio Code (VSC) for the purpose of writing and interpreting the code. Walkthroughs 7 to 9 made introductions to error handling, Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the requirement for testing Python code. Walkthroughs 10 and 11 introduce logging using Python and networking utilities while walkthrough 12 rounds off with guidance on how to create a project structure. The code presented in each of the exercise folders here was created from each of the walkthroughs

## Getting-Started
All code can be run using Visual Studio Code or appropriate IDE.<br/>

## Prerequisites
- Language: Python 3.10.8
- Visual Studio Code version 1.71.2
- OS: Windows or Linux.

## Testing
The importance of integrating testing into reusable code is demonstrated in walkthrough 9. The use of the library pylint, a static code analyser, demonstrates how to test code for possible errors and enforces coding standards. Unittest helps isolate what is broken in a script and enables fixing it faster by checking single components of code such as functions and ensuring that they perform as expected.
